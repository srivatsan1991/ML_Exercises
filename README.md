# ML_Exercises

In this project, we collect self-contained ipython notebooks, that implement increasingly complicated machine learning algorithms for the classification task applied to the CIFAR-10 dataset.  In particular, we implement the following:

* Support Vector Machine + Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) (38% accuracy)
* Two layer neural net with softmax loss function + SGD (49% accuracy)
* Convolutional neural nets?
